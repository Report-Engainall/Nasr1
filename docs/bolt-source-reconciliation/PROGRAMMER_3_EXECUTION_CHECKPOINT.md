ROUTES_COVERED: /categories; /collections; /admin/reports; /orders/$id; /orders/; /invoices; /statement; /assistant; /barcode; /offline; /login; /forgot-password; /register; /quotes; /reorder — targeted route wiring/tests only; full route acceptance remains open

TESTS_RUN_WITH_RESULTS:
- Core run 39958335414 on 22718ee03fc8bb9074d0f8444b701d04c8623669: SUCCESS, parent SHA only.
- P2 run 39958335519 on that parent: FAILED twice at external dependency install due HTTP 429; dependent browser jobs were skipped. Rerun was requested; no Playwright proof.
- Earlier Core/P2 runs 39954864338/39954864343 on c034c7a884deadd31458dc25ac73e1f95edebb53 passed their executed scopes; hosted authenticated E2E was SKIPPED.
- Local tests NOT RUN because clone was blocked by DNS.
- New commit exact-SHA tests PENDING.
TESTS_FAILED_OR_SKIPPED:
- P2 dependency mirror returned HTTP 429 twice on parent SHA, blocking test execution.
- Dedicated authenticated external E2E skipped on the older proven SHA due missing non-production credentials; not PASS.
- Full route browser UAT and production proof NOT RUN.
DEFECTS_FOUND:
- P3-CAT-ERR-001: source-specific category/catalog errors and retry implemented; earlier exact-SHA Core pass.
- P3-CAT-COUNT-002: inactive products excluded and empty-category links suppressed; strengthened count/link test passed on parent SHA.
- P3-REPORT-DUP-003: duplicate mount removed; runtime Reports mount test passed on parent SHA.
- P3-REPORT-LOAD-004: Arabic RTL reports loading status implemented; earlier Core pass.
- P3-CUST-ROUTE-LOAD-005/006: seven customer route loading fallbacks fixed and covered; parent Core pass.
- P3-CUST-ROUTE-LOAD-008: login, forgot password, registration, quotes and reorder loading fallbacks fixed; new exact-head result pending.
- P3-ROUTE-INVENTORY-001: 61 route sources; 50 UI/root sources not explicit in the existing matrix files. P2 handoff: https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Nasr1/pull/89#issuecomment-6365043277.
- P3-ROUTE-INVENTORY-002 / P1-ROUTE-TREE-EXPORT-001: generated tree omits admin_.exports; P1 handoff: https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Nasr1/pull/89#issuecomment-6365137817.
HANDOFF_TO_P1_OR_P2:
- P1: generator-backed route tree repair and direct /admin/exports proof; remaining 19 locked admin null fallbacks; no changes to P1 AghbariApp/auth/invitation/order-history paths.
- P2: route-to-source mapping in existing matrix, backend/RPC/migration ownership and package-cache HTTP 429 in P2 Playwright.
PR_URL: https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Nasr1/pull/89
MERGE_STATUS: OPEN; UNMERGED; no formal independent approval recorded.
BLOCKERS:
- Exact-head Core/P2 for this batch pending.
- P2 dependency cache HTTP 429 on previous SHA, even after retry.
- Local checkout DNS failure; all-route browser UAT/production proof NOT RUN.
NEXT_ACTION: capture resulting HEAD and exact-SHA Core/P2; fix code/test defects, retry dependency setup when mirror recovers, obtain independent review, merge only when latest-head checks are green and approval is recorded. Continue remaining independent route acceptance in parallel.
