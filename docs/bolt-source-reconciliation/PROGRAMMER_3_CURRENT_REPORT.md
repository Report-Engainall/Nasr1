# P3 current execution report — Nasr1

UPDATED_AT: 2026-10-23T16:10:00+03:00

## Git and current execution
- Repository: Report-Engainall/Nasr1
- PR #89: https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Nasr1/pull/89
- Branch: `p3/catalog-screen-error-states-20261023`
- Main/base observed: `59547c7d683cefd65cab445b97219aa701021676`; parent before this batch: `22718ee03fc8bb9074d0f8444b701d04c8623669`.
- Task `P3-CUST-ROUTE-LOAD-008`: five independent customer/auth route wrappers replace blank hydration fallbacks with semantic Arabic RTL loading states. New exact-SHA Core/P2 checks for this commit are pending.

## Implemented task IDs
- `P3-CAT-ERR-001`: category fetch failure, catalog failure, and combined failure separated on `/categories` and `/collections`, with source detail and retry.
- `P3-CAT-COUNT-002`: inactive products excluded from published category counts; no browse link for inactive-only categories.
- `P3-REPORT-DUP-003`: route-level duplicate `ExecutiveStoreAnalytics` mount removed; a runtime regression test renders real `AdminApp` Reports view and asserts one mounted panel.
- `P3-REPORT-LOAD-004`: Arabic RTL semantic loading state on `/admin/reports`.
- `P3-CUST-ROUTE-LOAD-005`: loading status on `/orders/$id`, `/orders/`, `/invoices`, and `/statement`.
- `P3-CUST-ROUTE-LOAD-006`: loading status on `/assistant`, `/barcode`, and `/offline`.
- `P3-TEST-QUALITY-007`: category regression includes a published target-category item, inactive rows and an active other-category row; it asserts exact count/link. Removed a vacuous route-stub assertion and added the runtime Reports mount test.
- `P3-CUST-ROUTE-LOAD-008`: `/login`, `/forgot-password`, `/register`, `/quotes`, and `/reorder` now provide Arabic RTL `role="status"` hydration fallbacks. The shared parameterized route test covers all twelve customer routes now changed. Route wrappers only; no auth provider or backend code changed.

## Exact-SHA evidence
- Core [39958335414](https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Nasr1/actions/runs/39958335414) on parent `22718ee03fc8bb9074d0f8444b701d04c8623669`: SUCCESS. This proves the previous review-remediation batch, not the five new route changes.
- P2 [39958335519](https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Nasr1/actions/runs/39958335519) on that same parent: failed twice during dependency setup due HTTP 429 from the configured Lovable package-cache for many package tarballs. The dependent public build/smoke and local-Supabase browser job did not run. A rerun was requested; its second attempt failed at the same external installation gate. No browser pass is claimed on that SHA.
- Older exact-SHA Core run [39954864338](https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Nasr1/actions/runs/39954864338) and P2 run [39954864343](https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Nasr1/actions/runs/39954864343) passed their executed scopes on `c034c7a884deadd31458dc25ac73e1f95edebb53`. Hosted authenticated E2E was SKIPPED due missing dedicated non-production credentials.
- Local tests NOT RUN because the environment could not resolve github.com for a shallow clone.
- Resulting commit SHA/new exact-head Core/P2 outcomes: pending; previous SHA statuses do not carry forward.

## Route inventory and ownership handoffs
- `src/routes/`: 61 source files, comprising 59 UI/root routes and 2 API handlers.
- `INTERFACE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.csv` has 10 rows and explicit paths for 9 route sources; `REMAINING_SCREEN_ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX_2026-10-22.csv` has 42 task rows and no explicit source-route paths. Fifty UI/root files are not explicitly mapped by those records. This is traceability debt, not proof they are broken; P2 owns updates to the existing canonical matrix.
- P1 `P1-ROUTE-TREE-EXPORT-001`: `src/routes/admin_.exports.tsx` exists but generated `src/routeTree.gen.ts` lacks `admin_.exports` while reports links to `/admin/exports`. Reachability NOT PROVEN. Handoff: https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Nasr1/pull/89#issuecomment-6365137817. Generated output untouched.
- P1 `P1-ADMIN-ROUTE-LOADING-001`: 19 other admin wrappers still use blank ClientOnly fallbacks; these P1-locked files were not changed.
- P1 PR #66 changed-file list was checked; the five route files changed in this batch were not in its diff. P1-owned `AghbariApp.tsx`, `auth.tsx`, customer invitation/order-history pages remain untouched.
- P2-owned shared matrix/state/coordination, backend contracts, RPCs, services and migrations were not edited.

## Review, blockers, and next action
- CodeRabbit's static review on prior SHA identified two test gaps; remediation is committed on the prior tested SHA, and new tests must now run on the current head. The review request for SHA `22718ee03fc8bb9074d0f8444b701d04c8623669` is at https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Nasr1/pull/89#issuecomment-6365584510. Static review is not a formal approval.
- P2 package-cache HTTP 429 remains an external blocker; the latest head must get fresh exact-SHA runs.
- All-route browser UAT, production proof/writes and live Onyx/WhatsApp calls: NOT RUN.
- PR #89 remains OPEN/UNMERGED, with no formal independent GitHub approval recorded.
- Fetch the resulting SHA, inspect exact-head Core and P2 jobs, retry P2 once registry throttling clears, respond to new review findings, and merge only once all required checks and independent review pass. Continue remaining unlocked route coverage.
